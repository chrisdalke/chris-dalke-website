Projects below are sorted by category. I've done a little bit of everything!

## Software Development
My main focus is software development. My current experience is in backend development and cloud-based infrastructure. Most of these projects are focused on technology outside career-specific work, because I enjoy tinkering with a diverse set of technologies. These are grouped categories, ranging from Hackathon projects to published works.

## Engineering
I spend a large amount of my time working on machining, woodworking, and electronics projects. I also work on many side projects through The Maker Mill, a local makerspace I've worked at for several years.
